    Required Attributes
    --------------------
    authors: List[str]
        The main researchers involved in producing the Garden. At least one
        author is required in order to register a DOI. Personal name format
        should be: "Family, Given".

    title: str
        An official name or title for the Garden. This attribute must be set
        in order to register a DOI.


    Recommended Attributes
    --------------------
    description: str
        A brief summary of the Garden and/or its purpose, to aid discovery by
        other Gardeners.

    pipelines: List[Pipeline]
        TODO

    Optional Attributes
    --------------------
    doi: str
        A garden's doi can be manually set by the user, or generated automatically via the
        DataCite rest api using the required fields.

    language: str
        Recommended values are IETF BCP 47, ISO 639-1 language codes, such as:
        "en", "de", "fr". Defaults to "en".

    tags: List[str]
        Tags, keywords, classification codes, or key phrases pertaining to the Garden.

    year: str
        Defaults to current year. This attribute should be formatted 'YYYY'.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a new Garden with a ``GardenClient`` instance::

        gc = GardenClient()
        pea_garden = gc.create_garden(
            authors=["Mendel, Gregor"], title="Experiments on Plant Hybridization"
        )
        pea_garden.year = 1863
        pea_garden.description = '''This Garden houses sophisticated ML pipelines
                                  for Big Pea Data extraction and classification.
                                  It consists of a 2-hectare plot behind the monastery,
                                  and a 30,000-plant dataset.'''

        gc.register(pea_garden)

    Notes
    --------
    Mendel's work was ignored by the scientific community during his lifetime,
    presumably due to the lack of a working DOI.
    To remedy this, if the `doi` field is unset when registering the garden, we
    build one for the user with the datacite api.
