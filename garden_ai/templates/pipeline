##################################### STEPS #####################################
"""
Brief notes on steps (see docs for more detail):

    - you may define your pipeline using as many or as few @steps as you like.

    - Any python function or callable can be made into a step by decorating it
        with `@step`, like below.

    - these functions will be composed in the pipeline (i.e. calling the pipeline
        is equivalent to calling each step in order).

    - the steps MUST have valid type-hints for all positional arguments and
        return types.
      - don't use `Any` or `None` in step annotations
      - these type-hints are used to verify that steps are compatible when
          composing (no checking at runtime)
