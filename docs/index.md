# ðŸŒ± Welcome to Garden ðŸŒ±

Garden is a framework designed to make it easier for the scientific community to benefit from FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for AI/ML models. Garden addresses key challenges faced by academic researchers in discovering, reproducing, and running AI/ML models:

1. **Reproducibility**: Garden eliminates environment inconsistencies by containerizing models, ensuring they run consistently across different systems.

2. **Discoverability**: With curated "Gardens" of models, researchers can easily find, compare, and curate relevant models for their work.

3. **Accessibility**: Garden simplifies the process of running models on diverse computing resources, from local machines to HPC clusters, via Globus Compute integration.

4. **Time-saving**: By handling environment management and system-specific quirks, Garden significantly reduces the time researchers spend on setup and configuration.

5. **Collaboration**: FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and standardized publishing make it easier for researchers to share their work and build upon others' contributions.

Garden lets researchers focus on their science, not on the intricacies of their software environments or computing infrastructure.
